# AsteroidsGame

This is a game created during my first semester of the [Master of Software Development (MSD)](https://msd.utah.edu/) program. It utilizes [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for the graphics. This was completed as a pared programming assignment with [Ted Pochmara](https://github.com/TedPoch). Created using Xcode as the IDE.

World.cpp is where the majority of the code is for this game.
